Hi there 👋, I am a computational epidemiologist 👨‍💻🦠 at the [Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM)](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch) at the [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch) 🏫, Switzerland 🇨🇭.

I employ mathematical and computational modeling alongside comprehensive data analyses to investigate how environmental changes and public health interventions influence the health of populations and the spread of infectious diseases. I am an expert on emerging infectious diseases and made major contributions to the better understanding of the transmission dynamics of Ebola, MERS, and COVID-19. I am a member of the [Multidisciplinary Center for Infectious Diseases (MCID)](https://www.mcid.unibe.ch) and the [Bern Data Science Initiative (BeDSI)](https://www.bedsi.unibe.ch) at the University of Bern, and I served as a member of the [Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force](https://sciencetaskforce.ch). Additionally, I chair the Executive Board of the Swiss Network for Infectious Disease Dynamics (SNIDDY). Beyond academia, I also serve as Deputy Head of the Section for Emerging Infectious Diseases and International Cooperation at the Swiss [Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH)](https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home.html).
