The symposium will be held at ETH Zürich Zentrum from the **9th to 11th February 2026**.
Speakers from a wide range of disciplines will discuss epidemics of the past, present, and future, and how we can learn valuable lessons from the past to better handle present and future epidemics.

If you want to participate you need to register [here](https://latsis-epidemics.ethz.ch/).

There are also limited opportunities to present a short talk or poster at the symposium. You can submit your application any time, but we will begin to review applications on the **15th of December**.
