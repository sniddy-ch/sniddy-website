The **Swiss Network for Infectious Disease Dynamics** is a scientific association that unites researchers, practitioners, and students working in—or maintaining strong ties to—Switzerland in the fields of infectious disease dynamics, modeling, and epidemiology. It emerged from the Swiss Meeting for Infectious Disease Dynamics (SMIDDY), a yearly seminar launched in 2010 to foster collaboration and exchange of ideas among experts. By providing a forum for interdisciplinary dialogue and joint research, the Swiss Network for Infectious Disease Dynamics helps strengthen the country’s capacity to understand, model, and respond to infectious disease threats at both national and international levels.
